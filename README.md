# 🌐 miniproj_C_lang

## 📖 About
This repository showcases mini-projects in C programming language, developed for academic practice, hackathons, and skill-building in core programming concepts.[memory:1][memory:2][web:15]

Key projects demonstrate input handling, calculations, decision-making, loops, and functions—perfect for students and junior developers preparing for competitions like Imagine Cup.[conversation_history:6][web:16]

More programs will be added over time, focusing on practical problem-solving with C.[web:20]

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Basic input/output with scanf/printf
- Loops (for, while) and conditional statements (if-else)
- Functions and modular code
- Arrays and strings (e.g., strlen, strcpy)
- Math operations and grading systems
- Menu-driven programs and simple games

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- **Student Marks Grading System**: Computes total marks, percentage, and assigns grades (A-F) for multiple subjects based on user input.[memory:2][conversation_history:6][web:17][web:21]
- **Basic Exercises**: Array operations, linear search, sum calculations, Fibonacci series, swapping numbers with pointers.[memory:1][web:15]
- Additional examples: Data types demo, number guessing game concepts.[web:20]

## 📋 How to Run
1. Install a C compiler like GCC (e.g., via MinGW on Windows or built-in on Linux/Mac).[web:26]
2. Open terminal in the project folder.
3. Compile: `gcc filename.c -o output`
4. Run: `./output` (Linux/Mac) or `output.exe` (Windows)
5. Test with sample inputs and modify code for learning.[conversation_history:4]

## 🔧 Compilation Tips
Use `gcc -Wall -o program program.c` for warnings during development. Debug with printf statements for variable tracing.[web:26]
